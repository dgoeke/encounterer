# Encounterer

A tool to help DMs in 13th Age run encounters smoother. Track players and NPC
engagements, hit points, statuses, and initiative. Eventually.

## Development Mode

### Start Cider from Emacs:

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl "(do (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)

### Compile css:

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once
```

Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto
```

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

## Production Build


To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
